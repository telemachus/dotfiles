# TODO

## 2023-11-16

### Immediate

+ Revise nvim-link.sh. Link the entire config directory to ~/.config.
+ Polish and clean up init.lua.

### Eventually

+ Go over all the little start-up scripts.  Remove some and consolidate
  others.
+ Add better error handling in all shell scripts.
+ Use shellcheck on all shell scripts.
+ Reconsider macOS.sh.  Do I want that at all anymore?
+ Investigate how to get matchit support for curly quotes.
